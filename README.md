# Alcohol-Sleep_Netpyne_model-
This repository contains simulation code and visualizations from a computational neuroscience project investigating the impact of alcohol consumption and sleep deprivation on neuronal activity and memory-related network dynamics.
The project integrates;
üß¨ Network-level and CA3 hippocampal simulations using NetPyNE https://github.com/suny-downstate-medical-center/netpyne/tree/development/netpyne/tutorials

üîç Goals
Model how alcohol and sleep-related factors affect spiking activity and neural synchrony.

Explore emergent network behaviors (e.g., disinhibition, firing variability) beyond single-cell effects.

Demonstrate how parameter tuning (e.g., synaptic weights, input noise) reflects real-world neurobiology.
